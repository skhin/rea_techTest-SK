 For my Front End, I used Vue / Bulma
 For my Back End, I used Django
 (*Disclaimer: I was suppose to use Nuxt.js)
 
 The app has 2 categories attached to it: Singapore and Hong Kong with various listings. 
 Singapore is suppose to have 7% GST whilst Hong Kong is suppose to have 3% GST. 
 Unfortunately, I was only able to implement 7% GST to all the listings instead of separating them. 
 Furthermore, there was supposed to be 2 separate buttons, one for agent call and the other for agent visit. I was only able to implement one button.

 I was unable to use the vue i18n translation tool due to the time limitation of learning it. I will learn more about its implementation moving forward.
